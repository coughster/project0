                <h4 id="acadia">Acadia National Park</h4>
                <h5>Mount Desert Island, ME, USA</h5>
                <p>I've been lucky enough to call Mt. Desert Island home for many summers. Acadia is a fantastic National Park with many great hikes, unspoiled ponds, unique habitats, and in turn, incredible birds. I recall encountering young scruffy looking Barred Owl chicks at Sieur de Mont Spring, Blackburnian Warblers and Northern Parulas singing overhead in the treetops all over the island, and of course the famous Bar Harbor boat tour to see Atlantic Puffins, Razorbills, and many other seafaring birds.</p>

                <h4 id="alondra">Alondra Park Reservoir</h4>
                <h5>Los Angeles, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>This city park has become a bit of a running joke amongst me and my local birder friends. It has continuously served as year-round home to a lone male Canvasback - a type of duck. Oft times when were working towards a daily species count goal and have not seen a Canvasback, we end the day at Alondra late at night, shining flashlights into the water to confirm the presence of this unique duck.</p>

                <h4 id="amager">Amagerfælled</h4>
                <h5>Copenhagen, Denmark</h5>
                <p>While visiting my brother studying abroad in Copenhagen in 2015, I wandered to a nearby natural area in the outskirts called Amagerfælled. It is a partial wetland, relatively managed with many walking paths throughout. Highlights included a flyover Peregrine Falcon and a pair of Ring-necked Pheasant.</p>

                <h4 id="angeles">Angeles National Forest / Angeles Crest Highway</h4>
                <h5>Los Angeles County, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>Winding through the mountains above Los Angeles, the Angeles Crest Highway carves through the San Gabriels, locally protected as the Angeles National Forest. I've spent many summer nights up here camping, as well as just going for an evening drive to see what owls might respond to recordings. Alpine species like White-headed Woodpecker, Pygmy Nuthatch and Mountain Chickadee are commonplace year-round. Come winter most of the road is closed for snow, but with the snow comes a chance of invading finches from the north looking for pinecone crops - Red Crossbills and Evening Grosbeaks. In summertime, migratory species like Green-tailed Towhee and Fox Sparrow breed in the mountains, and are worth at least a few visits.</p>

                <h4 id="av">Antelope Valley</h4>
                <h5>Los Angeles County, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>The flat, desert region in the north of L.A. County known as Antelope Valley is a combination of farmland, barren fields, and scrub. Ferruginous Hawks dot the skyline in winter, desert specialties like LeConte's Thrasher skitter between bushes. The man-made oases of Piute Ponds and Apollo Park stand out as excellent stopover sites for migrants. The "A.V." as we call it, is also the the only place in the county to consistently find Mountain Plovers, in the culled fields during winter months.</p>

                <h4 id="blackwater">Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge</h4>
                <h5>Eastern Shore, MD, USA</h5>
                <p>I've only driven through this NWR once in the dusk of a February evening, 2011. But the sightings were unforgettable. Soaring through the dying light like ghosts, hunting singly and cresting across car headlights as we wound through the swamps, were at least 5 Short-eared Owls. A magical viewing experience.</p>

                <h4 id="bolsachica">Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve</h4>
                <h5>Orange County, CA, USA</h5>
                <p>A well known treasure of Southern California birding, Bolsa Chica holds some of the best preserved habitat along the coast. No doubt that the crowds of birds rely on it due to it's stance as a last refuge of undeveloped coastal wetlands. Shorebirds like Red Knots and Long-billed Curlews, wading birds like Reddish Egrets, and many tern species all pass through here, while gracing few other coastal spots in the area.</p>

                <h4 id="brownsville">Brownsville Landfill</h4>
                <h5>Brownsville, TX, USA</h5>
                <p>An unexpected hotspot, the Brownsville dump on the southern tip of Texas has become a birding Mecca for travelers to try and glimpse the Tamaulipas Crow on U.S. soil. I have been twice over the years, and struck out both times. But I will no doubt one day return to eventually see a crow sitting on a pile of trash.</p>
